# Parks & Pages 

This application is a search tool for the avid hiker and reader.  The user can search for their state in the U.S., and a list of national and/or state parks appears on the next page, with a map showing the park locations.  Once they find a park they want to check out, the application uses the Google Books API to show book results that are related to the park.  Then, the user can save the books they are interested in to a favorite books list, displayed on the favorite books page.
